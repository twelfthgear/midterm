    <h1>Lost Memories</h1>

    <h3>You see a collection of random objects.</h3>
    <h3>First there is a small toy. A small rattle, something that would only interest a young toddler.</h3>
    <h3>The next is a framed photo of a young boy proudly holding a fishing pole with a small catfish. His toothy grin and wild brown hair amuses you.</h3>
    <h3>Another object follows the picture. This time it's a baseball cap. Long since faded with time, it bares no allegance to any team.</h3>
    <h3>The last object you have a hard time focusing on.</h3>
    <h3>This object is another photo frame but when you try to look at it, it gets hazy and your head begins to hurt.</h3>
