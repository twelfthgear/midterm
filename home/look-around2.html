    <h1>The Abandoned Cabin</h1>
    
    <h3>You turn away from the door to realize the space you had once entered is no more.</h3>
    <h3>Toward the front of this vacant space there is a lone, stainless steel door. </h3>
    <h3>The kitchenette to the far left has disappeared and it's contents have vanished.</h3>
    <h3>The curtains are now tattered and sapped of their once contrasting colors.</h3>
    <h3>Where the roaring fire once sat, a hollow space filled with long cold ashes remains in it's place.</h3>
    <h3>You still feel as if you are being watched in this small space.</h3>
    <h3>You are still slightly unsettled.</h3>
