    <h1>The Frozen Landscape</h1>
    
    <h3>You crack open the door and are met with a blast of chilling wind. It doesn't bite much else other than your mostly uncovered face.</h3>
    <h3>Before you, a frozen wasteland expands as far as the eye can see.</h3>
    <h3>Visibility isn't terrible, as you can see mountains straight ahead.</h3>
    <h3>To the left of the mountains you see a wooded forest comprised of many freshly snowed on pine trees.</h3>
    <h3>A quick scan of the surrounding land presents nothing but crystalline, white plains</h3>
