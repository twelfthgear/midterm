    <h1>A STRANGER?</h1>

    <h3>Something about the name James strikes you as important.</h3>
    <h3>He even looks familiar.</h3>
    <h3>Roughly 5'9, dirty blonde hair, mole under his right eye, brown eyes, goofy grin.</h3>
    <h3>Hell, even the sweat he is wearing seems familiar.</h3>
    <h3>Your head soon begins to hurt as you focus on the photo.</h3>
    <h3>You push the thought from your mind as you look away from the photo frame.</h3>
